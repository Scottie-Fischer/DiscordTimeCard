teamwork makes the dream work
play hard, work harder
always deliver more than expected
working is a priviledge not a right
we love the go-getters
if you can dream it you can achieve it
the chain is only as strong as its weakest link
every problem is a gift for you to work harder
unlearn the words quit and PTO
if our, rich from birth, CEO can do it, so can you
we all have the same 24 hours in a day
follow your heart, to work more
hard work pays off (not in cash)
we are a family
care, grow, win together (by getting back to work)
one team, one dream
(we) expect more, and pay (you) less
we are an inclusive company, all can equally work for no pay
you guys make the difference, and make corporate money
